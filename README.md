# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a technology or method used to detect and identify human emotions by analyzing facial expressions. It typically involves computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust from facial features.


Key Components:
Face Detection – Locating and isolating the face in an image or video.

Facial Feature Extraction – Identifying specific features (e.g., eyes, eyebrows, mouth) or using landmarks to describe the facial structure.

Emotion Classification – Using machine learning or deep learning models (like CNNs or RNNs) to classify the extracted features into predefined emotional categories.

Applications:
Human-computer interaction

Mental health monitoring

Marketing and customer experience analysis

Security and surveillance
