# Stress Detection using Facial-Emotion-Recognition
Stress Detection Using Facial Recognition involves analyzing a person‚Äôs facial expressions, micro-expressions, and sometimes physiological indicators (like skin color changes) to assess signs of stress. This builds upon Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) but focuses specifically on identifying stress-related cues.

üîç How It Works:
Face Detection:

Locate and isolate the face using algorithms like Haar cascades, MTCNN, or Dlib.

Facial Landmark Detection:

Identify key points (e.g., eyes, eyebrows, lips, jawline) to track facial movements.

Feature Extraction:

Measure features like:

Furrowed brows

Tensed jaw

Lip compression

Eye blinking rate

Pupil dilation (if camera quality allows)

Classification:

A machine learning or deep learning model (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM) classifies these features as "stressed" or "non-stressed."

Often trained on labeled datasets with varying stress levels.

Optional Additions:

Combine with heart rate estimation (via remote photoplethysmography from face videos).

Include context or behavioral data for higher accuracy.



üß† Common Models Used:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ‚Äì for spatial feature learning.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)/LSTMs ‚Äì to model temporal changes in expression over time.

Hybrid models ‚Äì combining CNNs for feature extraction and LSTMs for time series analysis.


‚úÖ Applications:
Mental health monitoring (telemedicine)

Workplace stress management

Automotive safety (driver fatigue/stress)

Real-time emotion tracking in interviews or high-stakes settings
